Apple HealthKit currently does not support a web API to fetch your tracked data.

However, you can use the [Google Fit](./google-fit) integration instead:

1. Install the Google Fit app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-fit-activity-tracker/id1433864494)
2. Track your workouts regularly, using any HealthKit-compatible app
3. Google Fit will fetch the data from HealthKit and upload it to Google Fit
4. Use the [Google Fit](./google-fit) integration
