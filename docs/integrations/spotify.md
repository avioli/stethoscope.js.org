## Intro

The Spotify API is used to track your music listening history and track library. Add the key `spotify` under `daily` to fetch this data every day:

```yaml title=".stethoscoperc.yml"
daily:
  - spotify
```

## Data points

The following data points are available for this integration:

| Data point   | Description       |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| `history`    | Listening history |
| `library`    | Library           |
| `topTracks`  | Top tracks        |
| `topArtists` | Top artists       |

```yaml title=".stethoscoperc.yml"
config:
  spotify:
    history: true
    library: true
    topTracks: true
    topArtists: true
```

## Authentication

You need to register an application on [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com) and will receieve a client ID and client secret. Use these credentials to generate an access/refresh token pair, which is used to authenticate with the Spotify API.

The [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/) required when generating credentials are:

- `user-top-read` (top artists and content)
- `user-library-read` ("Your Music" library)

To generate tokens when you don't have a OAuth flow set up, add the default URL http://localhost:3000/callback under "Redirect URIs" in your Spotify app, and run the `callbackUrl` function:

```bash
node -e 'require("./lib/api/spotify").callbackUrl()'
```

Running the above will log the URL to visit in your web browser, for example:

```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=557694afa2dc0589efcfe18e3e82bce6&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&scope=user-top-read%20user-library-read&state=state
```

This URL will redirect you to a URL starting with http://localhost:3000/callback, which looks like this:

```
http://localhost:3000/callback?code=NDQ_cib1isb_nvYaShKXapeq7Q4GZHxs3ntGizJ9_kN27CG900qYeooVbjwhm81VUi1qH9v5WZ2GDExPmgMwMKh7_qWCQEj4ANsI-pjVqAyGcEQ_al6A2wNz_Rj1WsqLG370cNrkS94G30R0ycqfagS7TeIkdwjXa2rofa3yanGFL0QghTPZ1FW1LI_1JSPTpKZf-4Rv3gPzEQsGd3UrAdrkQRJt&state=state
```

In this above URL, the query parameter after `?code=` and before `&state=` is your `code`. You can exchange this for the required tokens, like so:

```bash
node -e 'require("./lib/api/spotify").authTokens("YOUR_CODE")'
```

This will log your access token and refresh token to the console. Copy and paste these and set them as the environment variables described above.

## Environment variables

When the tokens are generated, you can set the following environment variables:

| Environment variable    | Description   |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`     | Client ID     |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret |
| `SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`  | Access token  |
| `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Refresh token |
